This mod allows you to drink and smoke at any time.  
Press "U" to smoke while walking and "I" to drink.  
The behavior of these "personalized tasks" wants to remain as truthful to R* immersive vision as possible.  

**Requires [ScriptHookV](http://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/)**

## Controls: 
Smoking - Keyboard: **"U" key**; Controller: **R3 + DPAD Left**  
Drinking - Keyboard: **"I" key**; Controller: **L3 + DPAD Left**  

## Installation: 
Simply extract the ASI inside the game's root directory (where you have installed GTA:V and Script Hook V, **not** inside the "scripts" folder).
